# Facenet

PHASE 0 – PREREQUISITES

Mathematics (only essentials):

Euclidean distance + 

Cosine similarity +

Loss functions 

Difference between softmax and metric learning

Deep Learning Basics:

CNN fundamentals (convolution, pooling, stride, padding)

Overfitting and regularization

Transfer learning

Goal:
Understand why FaceNet does not use softmax classification.

PHASE 1 – INCEPTION ARCHITECTURE

Concepts to Learn:

Motivation behind Inception

Inception v1, v3, v4

Parallel convolutions

1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction

Why Inception:

Multi-scale feature extraction

Efficient computation

Strong representation for faces

Practice:

Load pretrained InceptionV3

Extract feature vectors from images

No training required at this stage

Mastery Check:

Explain why Inception works well for faces

Explain why FaceNet uses Inception-based backbones

PHASE 2 – MTCNN (FACE DETECTION & ALIGNMENT)

MTCNN Structure:

P-Net (Proposal Network)

R-Net (Refine Network)

O-Net (Output Network)

Key Concepts:

Bounding box regression

Non-Max Suppression (NMS)

Facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth)

Importance of face alignment

Practice:

Detect faces in images

Detect faces from webcam

Detect faces in videos

Align faces using landmarks

Pipeline:
Raw Image -> MTCNN -> Aligned Face

Mastery Check:

Detect multiple faces in real time

Explain why alignment improves recognition accuracy

PHASE 3 – FACENET (CORE RECOGNITION)

Core Concepts:

Face embeddings
